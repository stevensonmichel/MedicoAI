# MedicoAI
Accurate estimation of healthcare costs plays a vital role in optimizing resource allocation and enhancing patient care. This project focuses on developing a predictive model using the XGBoost algorithm to accurately forecast individual health costs with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of less than $2400 USD. This Python script is designed to predict healthcare expenses using a dataset with various features such as age, sex, BMI, the number of children, smoking status, and region. The script uses several Python libraries including pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for data visualization, and scikit-learn and TensorFlow for machine learning.

**1-Description**

The project leverages a rich dataset of medical records, encompassing a wide array of variables including age, gender, and BMI, to predict healthcare costs, a task complicated by the multifaceted nature of medical expenses. Initial challenges such as missing data and potential outliers are mitigated through advanced imputation techniques and robust outlier treatment, preserving the integrity of the dataset while enhancing the predictive power of the model.

Feature engineering stands central to this endeavor, facilitating the capture of intricate patterns through the creation of derived features that encapsulate interactions and non-linear relationships. This is complemented by a strategic feature selection process, which curtails overfitting and bolsters the model's generalizability and interpretability by retaining only the most pertinent features.

The XGBoost algorithm, renowned for its adeptness in handling complex datasets and capturing non-linear relationships, is employed as the predictive backbone of the project. A meticulous hyperparameter tuning process, coupled with cross-validation, ensures the model's robust performance on unseen data, ultimately achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) below $2400 USD in healthcare cost predictions.

This achievement not only validates the effectiveness of the adopted approach but also highlights the pivotal role of data-driven strategies in navigating the complexities of healthcare financial planning and patient care. The project thus stands as a significant stride towards more informed and efficient healthcare budgeting and planning on a global scale.

**2-Setup**

Before running the script, ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from the Python official website.
Next, clone the repository or download the script and the requirements.txt file to your local system.

**3-Installing Dependencies**

Navigate to the directory containing the requirements.txt file in your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install all necessary packages.


**4-Running the Script**

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the script using the following command in your terminal or command prompt: script_name.py
Replace script_name.py with the actual name of your script.


**5-Script Workflow**

The script starts by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset from a CSV file.
It then performs exploratory data analysis, including checking for missing values and categorical values.
The categorical values are encoded using one-hot encoding.
The script splits the data into training and validation sets.
Mutual information scores are calculated to understand the relationship between different features and the target variable.
A Gradient Boosting Regressor model is trained on the training data.
Finally, predictions are made on the validation data and the mean absolute error is calculated to evaluate the model's performance.


**6-Output**

The script prints various details about the dataset, including the number of rows and columns, the first few rows of the dataset, and information about the columns. It also prints the mutual information scores and the mean absolute error of the predictions.


**7-Conclusion**

You should now have a working Python script that can predict healthcare expenses based on various features. Feel free to modify the script to use different machine learning models, feature engineering techniques, or to add more visualizations.
